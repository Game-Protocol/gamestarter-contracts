# Game Starter - Plan



## Short Description

1. Initial registration and verification.
    * Registeration of the game/company on the Game starter website.
    * Verification of the account by the game starter team.
2. Deployment of contracts.
    * Deployment of the token for the project after the creator selects the token type and fills in the required constructor parameters.
    * Deployment of the crowdsale contract for the token.
    * Deployment of the GPT to the newly created token converter using the bancor converter.
3. After the end of the crowdsale, as we finalize the crowdsale, funds will be transfered from the crowdsale to the convertor liquidity pool so the token could be converted with GPT and thus all other Bancor platform tokens.
